It turns out that each sound card requires a custom hacking of /boot/config.txt to
reflect the audio hardware that's installed.

This is unfortunate, this means that we need to keep a set of possible overlays
in order to push the right one.  The boot directory contains a version of config.txt
for each of the different sound cards we've tested.
